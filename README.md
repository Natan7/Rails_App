## Getting Started

1. Install Rails at the command prompt if you haven't yet:

        $ gem install rails

2. Change directory to `Rails_App` and start the web server:

        $ cd Rails_App
        $ rails server

   Run with `--help` or `-h` for options.

3. Using a browser, go to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see:
"Yay! Youâ€™re on Rails!"

4. Follow the guidelines to start developing your application. You may find
